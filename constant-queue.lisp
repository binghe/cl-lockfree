;;;; Queues With Constant Insert, Dequeue, and Delete Operations

(in-package :lockfree)

;;; The following forms implement a type of queue which has constant time
;;; insert, dequeue, and delete operations.

;;; The lock-free verion is based on algorithms from following papers:
;;;
;;; Sundell, HÃ¥kan. Efficient and practical non-blocking data structures.
;;; Department of Computer Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, 2004.

;;; The structure `queue-element' is used to represent the elements of constant
;;; queues.  They have next-element, previous-element, and datum slots.  Note
;;; that these structures are declared to explicitly be of type vector, so as to
;;; eliminate the name and save a word of memory per instance.  Note that this
;;; means there is no predicate for this structure.

;;; If the current node is the tail dummy node, false is returned in line NT2.
;;; In line NT3 the next pointer of the current node is de-referenced and in
;;; line NT4 the deletion state of the found node is read. If the found node
;;; is deleted and the current node was deleted when directly next of the
;;; found node, this is detected in line NT5 and then the position is updated
;;; according to [Def 1]* in line NT10. If the found node was detected as
;;; present in line NT5, the cursor is set to the found node in line NT10 and
;;; true is returned (unless the found node is the tail dummy node when
;;; instead false is returned) in line NT11. Otherwise it's checked if the
;;; found node is not already fully deleted in line NT6 and then fulfils the
;;; deletion by calling the HelpDelete procedure after which the algorithm
;;; retries at line NT2. The linearizability point of a Next function that
;;; succeeds is the read sub-operation of the next pointer in line NT3. The
;;; linearizability point of cursor was the tail dummy node, and the read sub-
;;; operation of the next pointer in line NT3 otherwise.

;;; [Def 1] The position of a cursor that references a node that is present in
;;; the list is the referenced node. The position of a cursor that references
;;; a deleted node, is represented by the node that was logically next of the
;;; deleted node at the very moment of the deletion (i.e. the setting of the
;;; deletion mark). If that node is deleted as well, the position is equal to
;;; the position of a cursor referencing that node, and so on recursively. The
;;; actual position is then interpreted to be at an imaginary node directly
;;; previous of the representing node.

;;; The `InsertAfter' operation inserts a new node directly after the node
;;; positioned by the given cursor and later changes the cursor to position
;;; inserted node. If the node positioned by the cursor is the tail dummy
;;; node, the new node will be inserted directly before the tail dummy node.
;;; The algorithm checks in line IA1 if the cursor position is equal to the
;;; tail dummy node, and consequently then calls the `InsertBefore' operation
;;; to insert the new node directly after the head dummy node. The algorithm
;;; repeatedly tries in lines IA4-IA14 to insert the new node (node) between
;;; the cursor positioned node and the next node (next) of the cursor, by
;;; atomically changing the next pointer of the cursor positioned node to
;;; instead point to the new node. If the update of the next pointer of the
;;; cursor positioned node by using the CAS operation in line IA7 fails, this
;;; is because either the next node is no longer the directly next node of
;;; the cursor positioned node, or that the cursor positioned node is deleted.
;;; If the cursor positioned node is deleted, the operation to insert directly
;;; after the cursor position now becomes the problem of inserting
;;; directly before the node that represents the cursor position according to
;;; [Def 1]*. It is detected in line IA11 if the cursor positioned node is
;;; deleted and then it calls the `InsertBefore' operation in line IA13. If
;;; the update using CAS in line IA7 succeeds, the cursor position is set to
;;; the new node in line IA15 and the prev pointer of the previous cursor
;;; positioned node is updated by calling the `HelpInsert' function in line
;;; IA16. The linearizability point of the InsertAfter operation is the
;;; successful CAS operation in line IA7, or equal to the linearizability
;;; point of the InsertAfter operation if that operation was called in line
;;; IA1 or IA13.
